As a response to the courage and wisdom of these women, I sought to express my admiration and support through the medium of art. With each brushstroke and pixel, I crafted a visual representation of their unwavering determination. The art speaks to the intertwined nature of climate change and human rights, as these women, despite their age, recognize that the urgency of this global crisis transcends generations.</p>
